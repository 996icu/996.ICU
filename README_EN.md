996.ICU
=======
* [Chinese version](./README.md)
  
The name `996.ICU` refers to **"Work by '996', sick in ICU"**, an ironic saying among Chinese programmers, which means that by following the "996" work schedule, you are risking yourself getting into the ICU (Intensive Care Unit).

What is 996?
---

A "996" work schedule refers to an unofficial work schedule (9 a.m. ~ 9 p.m., 6 days per week) that has been gaining in popularity. Serving a company that encourages the "996" work schedule usually means working for at least 60 hours per week.


What can I do?
---

- Update this [list](blacklist/blacklist.md) with evidence to help every worker.  
- Add this [badge](externals/instruction.md) to your project to support 996.ICU.  
- License your awesome projects with the [Anti 996 License](LICENSE).  
- Add proposals to give advise and suggestion about the development of 996.ICU.


Principles and purposes
---

* 996.ICU is an initiative initiated by IT practitioners. We welcome people from other fields and other countries to join the discussion.

* This is not a political movement. We firmly uphold the labor law and require employers to respect the legitimate rights and interests of their employees.

* It is a great progress from closed source to open source, and it will also be a great progress from open source to emphasize labor rights at the same time. What we want is to create an open source software license that advocates for workers' rights.

* We are willing to hear all positive and constructive proposals and advocate for mature and responsible speech.

* We are working on the drafting of Anti-996 License right now and we hope to get help from professionals with relevant experience.
