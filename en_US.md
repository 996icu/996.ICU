"996" refers to an unofficial work schedule (9 am - 9 pm, 6 days a week) that has been gaining more popularity. 
Working for a company that encourages the "996" work schedule usually means working for at least 60 hours a week.

Quoted from [Labour Law of the People's Republic of China](http://english.gov.cn/archive/laws_regulations/2014/08/23/content_281474983042473.htm):

However, the total extension in a month shall not exceed thirty six hours.  

**Article 43**:

## Gaining more popularity and publicity

In early September 2016, words spread that __*58.com*__ (`58同城`, a Chinese classified advertisements company) introduced the "996" work schedule, without paying employees overtime for working weekends. The company later claimed that this is only conducted annually during September and October in face of increased business activities, and that following the schedule is by no means compulsory.  

In early 2019, __*Youzan*__ (`有赞`), a Hangzhou-based Chinese E-commerce company, announced its planned adoption of the "996" work schedule at the company's annual convention. Bai Ya, the CEO of Youzan, responded: "This would definitely prove to be a right decision when we look back in a few years time."  

In mid-March 2019, it was reported that __*JD.com*__ (`京东`, a major Chinese e-commerce company) started adopting "996" or "995" work schedules in some departments. Its PRs posted on their Maimai (`脉脉`, a Chinese real-name business social network platform) account: "(Our culture is) to devote ourselves with whole hearts (to achieve the business objectives)."  

Although it is only gaining more publicity recently, this work schedule is a known "secret" practiced in a lot of companies in China.
## Compensation and benefits

According to the Labour Law, employees who follow the "996" work schedule deserve to be paid 2.275 times of their base salary. Unfortunately, people who work under "996" rarely receive overtime pay.
