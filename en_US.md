## Gaining more popularity and publicity

In early 2019, a Chinese E-commerce company called _Youzan_ announced the future adoption of the "996" work schedule at the company's annual party. The CEO of Youzan said, "This would definitely be a good decision when we look back in a few years time."

In Mid-March 2019, it was reported that JD.com started adopting a "996" or "995" work schedule in some of its business units. JD.com PR posted on their Maimai (`脉脉`, a Chinese real-name business social network platform) account that, "(Our culture is) to devote ourselves with all our hearts (to achieve the business objectives)."

Although it has been gaining more publicity recently, this work schedule is a commonly known "secret" practice for many companies in China.

## Compensation and benefits

According to the Labor Law, employees who follow the "996" work schedule deserve to be paid 2.275 times their base salary. Unfortunately, people who work under "996" rarely get paid for overtime hours.
