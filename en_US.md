## What is "996"?
996 working, ICU waiting.

"996" is an illegal work schedule (9 am - 9 pm, 6 days a week) that has become common. 
Working for a company that encourages the "996" work schedule usually means working for more than 60 hours a week.

Quoted from [Labour Law of the People's Republic of China](http://english.gov.cn/archive/laws_regulations/2014/08/23/content_281474983042473.htm):

**Article 36**:

**Article 39**:

**Article 41**:  
> The employing unit may extend working hours as necessitated by its production or business operation after consultation with the trade union and labourers, but the extended working hour per day shall generally not exceed one hour; if such extension is needed for special reasons, under the condition that the health of labourers is guaranteed, the extended hours shall not exceed three hours per day. However, the total extension in a month shall not exceed thirty six hours.  

**Article 43**:  
> The employing unit shall not extend working hours of labourers in violation of the provisions of this Law.

**Article 90**:

## Gaining more popularity and publicity

In early September 2016, words spread that __*58.com*__ (`58同城`, a classified advertisements company) introduced the "996" work schedule, without paying employees overtime for working weekends. The company later claimed that this was only conducted annually during September and October in face of increased business activities, and that following the schedule was by no means compulsory.  

In early 2019, __*Youzan*__ (`有赞`), a Hangzhou-based E-commerce company, announced its planned adoption of the "996" work schedule at the company's annual convention. Bai Ya, the CEO of Youzan, responded: "This would definitely prove to be a right decision when we look back in a few years."  

In mid-March 2019, it was reported that __*JD.com*__ (`京东`, a major E-commerce company) started adopting "996" or "995" work schedules in some departments. Its PRs posted the following on their Maimai (`脉脉`, a Chinese real-name business social network platform) account: "(Our culture is) to devote ourselves with whole heart (to achieve the business objectives)."  

Gaining more publicity only recently, this work schedule, however, has long been a known "secret" practiced in a lot of companies in China.
## Compensation and benefits

According to the Labour Law, employees who follow the "996" work schedule deserve to be paid 2.275 times of their base salary. Unfortunately, people who work under "996" rarely receive overtime pay.

## Where does the name of the repo `996.ICU` come from?

If you continue to tolerate the "996" work schedule, you will risk your own health and might need to stay in an _**I**ntensive **C**are **U**nit_ someday. (`6` rhymes with `U` in Mandarin)
