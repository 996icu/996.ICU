## Introducing "996"
996 working, ICU waiting.

The "996" work schedule refers to an illegal work schedule in China. It has been gaining popularity among companies. The schedule starts at 9 a.m. and ends at 9 p.m. each day, for 6 days a week.

Serving in a company that encourages the "996" work schedule usually means working for at least 72 hours a week.

## Gaining popularity and publicity

- In early September 2016, numerous reliable sources reported that  __*58.com*__  A.K.A. `58同城` (__*NYSE: WUBA*__), a classified advertisements company, practiced the "996" work schedule without overtime pay on weekends. The company later claimed that the schedule was only practiced to manage extra workload during the peak season (September and October) and that this schedule would not be mandatory.

- In January 2019, __*Youzan.com*__ A.K.A. `有赞` (__*HKG: 8083*__), a Hangzhou-based e-commerce company, announced in its annual gala, that the company would start enforcing the "996" work schedule. Bai Ya, the CEO of Youzan, responded,

  > "This will definitely be a right decision when we look back in a few years."

- In March 2019, __*JD.com*__  A.K.A. `京东` (__*NASDAQ: JD*__), a major e-commerce company, started enforcing "996" or "995" work schedules in some departments. The PR of JD stated on Maimai (`脉脉`, a Chinese business social network platform),

  > "[Our company culture is] the wholehearted devotion of ourselves [to achieve the business objectives]."

This work schedule is only gaining publicity recently. However, it has log been practiced as an "open secret" in many companies in China.

## Compensation and benefits

According to the Labour Law, employees who follow the "996" work schedule should be paid 2.275 times their basic salary. Unfortunately, employees rarely receive this payment.

## The origin of this repo's name -- `996.ICU`

Tolerating of the "996" work schedule will apparently result in creating health risk, which may send you to an _**I**ntensive **C**are **U**nit_ someday. (`6` rhymes with `U` in Mandarin)
