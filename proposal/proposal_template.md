## Why this Proposal?

I write this template for the whole community. <br>
I wish we can record useful and valuable suggestions and make them happen.

## Community Value

Provide a template for new proposals. <br>
A proposal can be used to record suggestions and agreements. <br>
Make the community members understanding and reviewing import decisions what have been made and discussed better.

## Problems

In this part, the proposer should describe what problems we are facing. <br>
For example, currently, we don't have a way to record import decisions and suggestions. <br>
Pull Requests area is too general and not a good way to express ideas. <br>
We need a much more formal channel.

## Solutions

In this part, the proposer should statement the solutions or proposals to solve these problems listed in ***Problems*** part. <br>
For example, we add the proposal directory in the repo and init this proposal template to help the community to build a much more formal channel for suggestion and discussion.

## Resource & Requirements

In this part, list out the resource or other requirements required by the proposal or solution.

## Actions & implementation Plan

In this part, the proposer should describe the actions and implementation plan after the proposal is approved by the community.

## References

In the part, list out links to the reference resource.
For example, for this proposal, the main reference is <br>
- [PEP 1 -- PEP Purpose and Guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/)
