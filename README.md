[996.ICU](https://996.icu)
=======
* [中文版](./README_CN.md)

The name `996.ICU` refers to **"Work by '996', sick in ICU"**, an ironic saying among Chinese developers, which means that by following the "996" work schedule, you are risking yourself getting into the ICU (Intensive Care Unit).

What is 996?
---

A "996" work schedule refers to an unofficial work schedule (9 a.m.&ndash;9 p.m., 6 days per week) that has been gaining popularity. Serving a company that encourages the "996" work schedule usually means working for at least 60 hours per week.
Visit [996 working hour system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/996_working_hour_system) on wikipedia for more details.


What can I do?

Principles and purposes
---

* 996.ICU is an initiative initiated by IT practitioners. We welcome people from other fields and other countries to join the discussion.

* This is not a political movement. We firmly uphold the labor law and request employers to respect the legitimate rights and interests of their employees.

* It is a great progress from closed source to open source, and it will also be a great progress from open source to emphasizing labor rights at the same time. What we want is to create an open source software license that advocates workers' rights.

* We are willing to hear all positive and constructive proposals and advocate mature and responsible speech.

Where are the issues?
---

Even with interaction limits on, the issues area was totally out of control.
So I **personally** decided to switch it off, not by GitHub or others.
