996.ICU
=======
The name `996.ICU` refers to **'Work by "996", sick in ICU'**, an ironic saying among Chinese programmers, which means that by following the "996" work schedule, you are risking yourself getting into the ICU (Intensive Care Unit).

What is 996?
---
A "996" work schedule refers to an unofficial work schedule (9 a.m. ~ 9 p.m., 6 days per week) that has been gaining in popularity. Serving a company that encourages the "996" work schedule usually means working for at least 60 hours per week.

The principle and purpose Of this repository!
---
* 996.ICU is an initiative initiated by IT practitioners. We welcome people from other fields and other countries to join the discussion.

* This is not a political movement. We firmly uphold the labor law and require employers to respect the legitimate rights and interests of their employees.
  
* It is a great progress from closed source to open source, and it will also be a great progress from open source to emphasize labor rights at the same time. What we want is to create an open source software license that advocates for workers' rights.

* We are willing to hear all positive and constructive proposals and advocate for mature and responsible speech.

* We are working on the drafting of 996 License right now and we hope to get help from professionals with relevant experience.

*****

* 996.ICU 是IT从业者发起的一项倡议，我们欢迎其他领域、其他国家的人士加入讨论。

* 这并不是一个政治运动，我们坚定维护劳动法，我们要求雇主尊重雇员的合法权益。

* 从闭源到开源是一次伟大的进步，从开源到同时强调保护劳工权益也将是一次伟大的进步，我们想要创造一个主张保护劳动者权益的开源软件许可证。

* 我们欢迎一切积极的、具有建设性意义的建议，倡导成熟的、负责任的发言。

* 目前 996ICU License 处于起草阶段，希望有相关经验的专业人士能给予帮助。
