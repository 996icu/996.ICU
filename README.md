The name `996.ICU` refers to **'Work by "996", sick in ICU'**, an ironic saying among Chinese programmers, which means that by following the "996" work schedule, you are risking yourself getting into ICU (Intensive Care Unit).

What is 996?
---
A "996" work schedule refers to an unofficial work schedule (9a.m. ~ 9p.m., 6 days a week) that has been gaining in popularity. Serving a company that encourages the "996" work schedule usually means working for at least 60 hours a week.

Where are the issues?

Even if with the interaction limits on, the issue area was totally lost of control.  
So I **personally** decided to switch it off, not by GitHub or others.
