996.ICU
=======
The name `996.ICU` refers to **'Work by "996", sick in ICU'**, an ironic saying among Chinese programmers, which means that by following the "996" work schedule, you are risking yourself getting into ICU (Intensive Care Unit).

What is 996?
---
A "996" work schedule refers to an unofficial work schedule (9 a.m. ~ 9 p.m., 6 days per week) that has been gaining in popularity. Serving a company that encourages the "996" work schedule usually means working for at least 60 hours a week.
