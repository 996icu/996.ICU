996.ICU
=======
The name `996.ICU` refers to **"Work in '996', sick in ICU."**, an ironic saying among Chinese programmers. It means that by working six 9-to-9 days a week, you are risking yourself getting into an ICU (Intensive Care Unit).

Where are the issues?

Even if interaction limits are set, the issue area has totally lost control.  
So I decided to switch it off **personally**, not by GitHub or others.
