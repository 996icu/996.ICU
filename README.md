996.ICU
=======

The name `996.ICU` refers to **"Work by '996', sick in ICU"**, an ironic saying among Chinese programmers, which means that by following the "996" work schedule, you are risking yourself getting into the ICU (Intensive Care Unit).

What is 996?
---

A "996" work schedule refers to an unofficial work schedule (9 a.m. ~ 9 p.m., 6 days per week) that has been gaining in popularity. Serving a company that encourages the "996" work schedule usually means working for at least 60 hours per week.

*****

“996”工作制，指的是一种越来越流行的非官方工作制（早上 9 点 ~ 晚上 9 点，每周 6 天）。在一个实行“996”工作制的公司工作就意味着每周至少要工作 60 个小时。

Principles and purposes
---

* 996.ICU is an initiative initiated by IT practitioners. We welcome people from other fields and other countries to join the discussion.

* This is not a political movement. We firmly uphold the labor law and require employers to respect the legitimate rights and interests of their employees.

* It is a great progress from closed source to open source, and it will also be a great progress from open source to emphasize labor rights at the same time. What we want is to create an open source software license that advocates for workers' rights.

* We are willing to hear all positive and constructive proposals and advocate for mature and responsible speech.

* We are working on the drafting of Anti-996 License right now and we hope to get help from professionals with relevant experience.

*****

* 996.ICU 是 IT 从业者发起的一项倡议，我们欢迎其他领域、其他国家的人士加入讨论。

* 这并不是一个政治运动，我们坚定维护劳动法，我们要求雇主尊重雇员的合法权益。

* 从闭源到开源是一次伟大的进步，从开源到同时强调保护劳工权益也将是一次伟大的进步，我们想要创造一个主张保护劳动者权益的开源软件许可证。

* 我们欢迎一切积极的、具有建设性意义的建议，倡导成熟的、负责任的发言。

* 目前反 996 许可证还处于起草阶段，希望有相关经验的专业人士能给予帮助。

Where are the issues?
---

Even with interaction limits on, the issues area was totally out of control.
So I **personally** decided to switch it off, not by GitHub or others.

*****

即使有互动限制，issues 区依然完全失去了控制。
因此我**个人**决定关闭 issues，这与 GitHub 或其他方面无关。
