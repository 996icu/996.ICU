996.ICU
=======
The name `996.ICU` refers to **"Work on '996', sick in ICU."**, an ironic saying among Chinese programmers. It means that by working six 9-to-9 days a week, you are risking yourself getting into an ICU (Intensive Care Unit).

What is 996?

A "996" work schedule refers to an unofficial work schedule (9 a.m. ~ 9 p.m., 6 days a week) that has been gaining popularity. Serving a company that encourages the "996" work schedule usually means working for at least 60 hours a week.

Even if interaction limits are set, the issue area has totally lost control.  
So I decided to switch it off **personally**, not by GitHub or others.
