# 996 Coin 996代币

996 Coin is an Ethereum-based digital token having at heart the well-being of the workers working in companies demanding the so-called "996" (9AM-9PM, Mon-Sat) working time.

996代币是一种基于“以太坊”区块链技术的数字代币，致力于关心那些在要求“996”工作制的公司工作的劳动者的福利。

Concrete speaking, a "996" worker can "check in" on the blockchain and get the issued 996 Coin in the "996" proof-of-work timespan, which means from 9PM to 12PM on Monday to Friday, and full day on Saturday. Timezone will be considered for adjustment.

具体而言，一个996劳动者可以通过在区块链上“打卡”来获得区块链自动发放的996代币奖励。打卡时间是该劳动者进行了996工作的工作量证明，即，在周一到周五的工作日的晚9点到12点，以及周六的全天，都是有效的打卡时间段。时间需要根据时区进行修正。

Some legally necessary information such as the "checking in" worker's IP address and time (timezone adjusted) will be forever recorded on the blockchain. These information could be used as possible legal evidence when needed, for example, to advocate overtime compensation, on the court in the furture.

一些法律上必要的信息，比如打卡人的IP地址和打卡时间（经时区调整的）将被永久记录在区块链上。这些信息可能被用作法律证据，以备将来在必要时使用，比如在法庭上主张加班补偿金。

Furthermore, more utility scenarios for 996 Coin could be developed to continuously improve the workers' benefits, as well as backing the coin value. For example, 996 Coins could be used for paying the treatment fee in the hospital, purchasing pills in the drugstore, or affording a lawsuit against the company, etc.

更进一步的，996代币更多的应用场景可以被开发出来，以持续改善劳动者的福利，以及支撑币值。比如，996代币可以被用于支付住院治疗费，在药店买药，或者用于负担法律诉讼费用，等等。

The total amount of 996 Coin will be 100,000,000,000 (with 18 decimal digits) locked in the welfare pool. Each "checked in" worker can receive 1/1,000,000,000 * left-over coins in the pool. For example, the first one will receive 100 tokens, the next will receive 99.9999999 tokens, the third will receive 99.9999998000000001, ..., etc. All numbers are programmed and predetermined by Math formula and automatically executed by smart contracts deployed on the blockchain, without intervention or help of any human beings.

996代币的总量恒定为1000亿（18位小数，即最小可细分为1/10^18），并锁定在福利池中。每一个打卡的劳动者可以领取代币池中未被领取代币总量的10亿分之一。也就是说，第一个打卡人可以领到100个代币，第二人可以领到99.9999999个代币，第三人可以领到99.9999998000000001个代币，……，以此类推。所有数字都是由数学公式预先决定，并由区块链上的智能合约代码自动执行，无需人工干预。

There will be NO intervention codes in the smart contracts. All codes will be open source and auditable by anyone. Due to the nature of the blockchain technology, once deployed, nobody will have the capability to take any responsibility to the code and the data. Math and algorithms will be fully in charge.

智能合约中将不写入任何可干预的代码。代码将全部开源，接受任何人的审查。由于区块链的天然性质，一旦部署，便没有人可以对代码和数据负有任何责任。数学和算法将全权负责。

Welcome any feedback and suggestions. We may kick start to implement it when we have a good enough whitepaper as above. :)

欢迎任何反馈和建议。当我们修订到一版足够好的白皮书后，也许就可以实现它了。:)
