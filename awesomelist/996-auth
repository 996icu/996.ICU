Project launches, and now my 996 begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, play no games, father no 
children. I shall care no families and have no life. I shall live and die at my desk. I am the ghost in the office. I am the 
spirit on the keyboard. I am the firewall that runs against the crackers, the editor that writes the code, the compiler that 
builds the programs, the machine that earns the money for bosses. I pledge my life and honor to my company, for this week and 
all the weeks to come.
