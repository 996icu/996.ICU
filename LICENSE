The above license is subject to the following additional conditions:

1. The licensee must strictly comply with all applicable labor laws
   where the individual is physically located or where the individual
   was born or naturalized; or where the legal entity is registered or
   is operating (whichever is stricter). In case that the jurisdiction
   has no such labor laws or its labor laws are unenforceable, the

   Standards, as outlined in the ILO Declaration on Fundamental
   Principles and Rights at Work of 1998. [local]

2. The licensee shall not reqiure employee(s) to directly or indirectly
   restrict, weaken or relinquish his or her rights or remedies under
   such laws, regulations, rules and standards relating to labor and
   employment as mentioned above, no matter whether such written or
   oral agreement are enforceable under the laws of the said
   jurisdiction, nor shall the licensee limit, in any methods, the
   rights of its employee(s) from reporting or complaining to the
   copyright holder or relevant authorities monitoring the compliance
   of the license about its violation(s) of the said license. [no-circ]

3. The licensee shall not require its employee(s) to be present at the
   workplace or work (whichever is longer) for more than 50 hours in a
   single week, nor shall the licensee require its employees to perform
   the aforementioned action for more than a consecutive 10 hours. [996]

If you modify the software, you must extend the above restriction to
your version of the software. All copies or substantial portions of
this software must include the text of this restriction.

Notes on use
============

The above restriction is incompatible with some free software licenses,
notably GPL and AGPL, due to it introducing a "further restriction."
Given how corporations tend to avoid GPL anyways, it is recommended
that developers only apply it to the more "linking friendly" licenses
such as the LGPL, MIT/X11, and BSD licenses.

When using this restriction with one of the above licenses, the
developer should also dual-license the software under GPL or AGPL, in
order to enable wider use by the free software community.
