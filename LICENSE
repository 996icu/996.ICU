  their employees to work more than 45 hours in any single week.
* The licensee must not, explicitly or implicitly, request or schedule
  their employees to be at work consecutively for 10 hours.

If you modify the software, you must extend the above restriction to

this software must include the text of this restriction.

Notes on use
============

The above restriction is incompatible with some free software licenses,
notably GPL and AGPL, due to it introducing a "further restriction."
Given how corporations tend to avoid GPL anyways, it is recommended
that developers only apply it to the more "linking friendly" licenses
such as the LGPL, MIT/X11, and BSD licenses.

When using this restriction with one of the above licenses, the
developer should also dual-license the software under GPL or AGPL, in
order to enable wider use by the free software community.
